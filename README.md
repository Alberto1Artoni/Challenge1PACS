# Challenge1PACS


computes the minimum of a function with different methods\n
to change the method go in:\n
-Grad.hpp and change Grad_mode defined variable in line 4 (0 if it's given the exact one, 1 if it's used the finite difference method to compute the gradient)\n
-Parameters.cpp in the function Minimum and change the strategy enumerator S in line 30 (Armijo to get Armijo rule or Inverse for the inverse decay rule)
